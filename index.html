			Hi, I am Gunvir Dhesi and I am currently a Grade 10 student at Chingouscy Secondary School. 
			Since a young age I have been fasinated with computers and electroics in general. In Grade 
			4/5 I was introduced to coding becuase of a game called <a id="link" href="https://agar.io/#ffa">Agar.io.</a> I started using a chrome extension 
			"Temper Monkey" to start making small game changes, little did I know this was going to 
			be the beggining of something big. In Grade 6 I attended a regional program(go to education 
			for more info) which gave me the chance to work with a lot more computers, I learnt about how
			 computers function and how the operatiing/bios work. Soon after with the help of my Grade 6 
			 teacher my class and I were going around our school to download and educate students about 
			 linux OS.
